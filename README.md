GraphMap: Dynamic City Routing with Dijkstra’s Algorithm
Description
GraphMap is a C++ program that finds the shortest paths between cities using a customized Dijkstra’s algorithm. It uses hash maps and adjacency lists to manage cities and roads dynamically, enabling efficient route planning.

Features
Dynamic management of cities and roads
Customized implementation of Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm
Efficient graph representation with adjacency lists and hash maps
Usage
The program allows adding roads between cities with distances.
Enter the source city name when prompted to get shortest paths from it.
The program outputs the shortest distance to all reachable cities.
