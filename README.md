# GraphMap1
GraphMap: City Routing with Dijkstra’s Algorithm  GraphMap is a C++ program that finds the shortest paths between cities using a custom Dijkstra’s algorithm. It uses hash maps to manage cities dynamically and adjacency lists to store roads. The project demonstrates efficient graph representation and route calculation for city navigation.
